# Maze-Solver
In the computer program, we can easily solve the maze problem by using the structure of the stack. The basic idea of the algorithm is to continuously explore the maze and store the explored roads in the stack. Whenever it reaches a dead end, the stack loop is executed until it finds the road to other directions in the branch road that has been explored before

The following is the algorithm implementation in C++ language.
